##This is a mathematical representation of a Five-Dimentional list
##hopefully I'll be able to make a plotted representation for it

f = [[[[[1,2],[2,3]],[[3,4],[4,5]]],
      [[[5,6],[6,7]],[[7,8],[8,9]]]],
     [[[[9,10],[10,11]],[[11,12],[12,13]]],
      [[[13,14],[14,15]],[[15,16],[16,17]]]]]

print f
